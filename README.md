## Task :man_technologist:
For this assignment, we were creating a web application that takes in user notes and saves them. 

The app is initiated at the home page by clicking the 'Get Started' button. Once clicked, you'll be taken to a page that will allow you to create notes with a header. When you're ready to save your note, click the save icon in the top right and the note will save in the left side of the page.
